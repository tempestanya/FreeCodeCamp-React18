# Standard Setup

## Standard React Setup

- "App" component is used to setup the root component, and it contains all the other components.
- Similar to "BookList" component in the BookList Project.
- `React.StrictMode` activates additional checks & warnings for all of its descendants.
- In this mode, the application runs twice. We can remove it if we want to.
- However, it is not going to affect the production build.
- We can split CSS into different files, but in the end it all gets piled up into one logic only.
- Therefore, we need to be careful while setting up multiple CSS files, as the files are not scoped to the component only but globally.

## Vite

- Insted of create-react-app, we will use vite to develop our React project.
- Much faster than create-react-app, and provides tons of great featurs.
- https://vitejs.dev/

```
npm create vite@latest app-name -- --template react
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Need to use .jsx extension in every file.
- index.html is inside the "src" folder instead of "public" folder.
- Now, instead of index.js, we need to use main.jsx!
- Command to spin up the dev server - `npm run dev`
- Local Host is going to be 5173.
